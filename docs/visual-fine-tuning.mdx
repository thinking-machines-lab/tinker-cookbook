# Cookbook: Visual Fine-Tuning

This section covers fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) with Tinker.

Tinker supports VLMs like `Qwen/Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Instruct` and `Qwen/Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Instruct`. These models can process both text and images, enabling use cases like:

- **Image classification**: Train models to categorize images into custom classes
- **Visual question answering**: Fine-tune for domain-specific image understanding
- **Document analysis**: Process screenshots, diagrams, or scanned documents
- **Multi-modal chat**: Build assistants that can discuss images in context

Check the [Model Lineup](/model-lineup) page for available vision model types.

## Key Concepts & Considerations

When training VLMs, there are a few important considerations:

1. **Image size limits**: Tinker enforces a maximum of **2MB** per image. Resize or compress images client-side before training.

2. **Vision tokens**: Images are converted to vision tokens by the model. You need to account for these when constructing training data.

3. **Renderers**: Use `Qwen3VLRenderer` or `Qwen3VLInstructRenderer` which handle vision special tokens (`<|vision_start|>`, `<|vision_end|>`) automatically.

The library code for VLM support can be found in <CookbookLink path="tinker_cookbook/image_processing_utils.py">`image_processing_utils.py`</CookbookLink> and the renderers module.
