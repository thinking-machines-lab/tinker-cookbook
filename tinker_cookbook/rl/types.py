    Builds a group of environments. The group will be used in the following way:

    - The reward function (compute_group_rewards) has access to the trajectories from the
      whole group, even though many reward functions will evaluate each one independently.

      - For example, this enables us to use pairwise reward models that look at a pair of
        trajectories at a time. With such a reward model, we effectively have a multi-agent
        environment, where the agents are playing a zero-sum game.

    Groups can be used in two ways, in practice:

    - To define a multi-agent environment
    - As a part of the *algorithm* (e.g. GRPO), when dealing with single-agent tasks.
