## RL Training with Tinker / Tinker Cookbook + GEM

[GEM](https://github.com/axon-rl/gem) is a library providing Gym-like environments for LLM RL. This document demonstrates how one can leverage Tinker (or Tinker Cookbook) to train RL agents on GEM environments.

In this guide, we present two implementations leveraging Tinker:
1. Standard Training with Cookbook Utilities:
   We introduce an adapter layer that enables GEM to work seamlessly with the Tinker Cookbookâ€™s training loop.
2. Custom Training via Low-level API:
   For advanced use cases, we provide a basic RL implementation that interacts directly with Tinkerâ€™s low-level API, enabling maximum customization.


### Getting Started

Assuming you have already installed `tinker` and `tinker-cookbook`, you can install `gem` from PyPI and prepare your tinker API key:
```bash
# install gem
pip install -U gem-llm

# export tinker api key
export TINKER_API_KEY=<your-tinker-api-key>
```

### Using Tinker Cookbook

To train agents with the Tinker Cookbook, we implemented an adaption layer (`tinker_cookbook_adapter.py`) that exposes a GEM-compatible interface. The entry point is `tinker_cookbook_train.py`.

**Example 1: Training on Math Environments**

```bash
python -m examples.train_tinker.tinker_cookbook_train env_id=math:Math12K groups_per_batch=64 group_size=16 learning_rate=2e-5 max_tokens=2048 model_name=Qwen/Qwen3-8B-Base env_kwargs_json='{"use_mp": false}'
```

Note:
- You may train on different math environments by simply changing the `env_id` argument.
- `env_kwargs_json='{"use_mp": false}'` is only required for math environments.

**Example 2: Training on Reasoning Gym**

```bash
python -m examples.train_tinker.tinker_cookbook_train env_id=rg:simple_equations groups_per_batch=64 group_size=8 learning_rate=2e-5 max_tokens=2048 model_name=Qwen/Qwen3-8B-Base
```

### Using Tinker

We can also directly integrate GEM with Tinker, bypassing the abstraction layer defined by tinker-cookbook. The entry point is `tinker_train.py`, which implements REINFORCE with Return Batch Normalization (introduced in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.01051)).

**Example 1: Training on Math Environments**

```bash
python -m examples.train_tinker.tinker_train model_name=Qwen/Qwen3-8B-Base env_id=math:DeepScaleR40K num_env=128 max_tokens=8192
```
* In this example we observe the increasing response length phenomenon (as in DeepSeek-R1-Zero) with LoRA training with rank 32!

**Example 2: Training on Math with Python Tool**

```bash
python -m examples.train_tinker.tinker_train env_id=math:Math12K num_env=128 max_tokens=2048 template=no model_name=meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct env_wrappers=python_tool_no_int_reward_last_line_error,concat_chat gamma=1
```

**Example 3: Training on Multi-turn Language Games**

```bash
python -m examples.train_tinker.tinker_train model_name=Qwen/Qwen3-8B-Base num_env=64 env_id=game:Sudoku-v0-easy max_tokens=1024 template=qwen3_game model_name=Qwen/Qwen3-8B-Base env_wrappers=concat
```

* Training is currently slow because in each turn the agent needs to think then act, and this process repeats sequentially. We can optimize it via prefix sharing, async sample/learn, etc.
